undefined signal BRAKE_PUMP_REQUEST - 506  commented out.. dbc does not have a pump request, only computer brake request.
    side note: COMPUTER_BRAKE_REQUEST_2 stays on longer than COMPUTER_BRAKE_REQUEST, I think 2 is a engine braking request by raising engine rpm via transmission

COUNTER signal type not valid    should have been fixed by changed dbc and interface.. not sure if fixed

CHECKSUM signal type not valid   should have been fixed by changed dbc and interface.. not sure if fixed
